# Off-Centre Camera
A mod for Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven (2002).

**Instructions:** Rename/the mission you want to test to 'TUTORIAL', and run the Tutorial. Patching rw_data.DLL with MafiaDataXtractor is required, (if you've never done it or never installed mods before).

**Notes:** This was just made as a proof-of-concept demonstration and so these four missions are all there is. No movement on the Z-axis and bugged shooting are unavoidable side effects of this method, so I won't work on it anymore.

**Download:** At the top of the repository's homepage, click the green *<> Code* button, and then *Download ZIP*.
